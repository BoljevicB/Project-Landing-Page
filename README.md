# Project-Landing-Page

My TOP project suggests making a landing page from scratch, with provided design ( consisted of a image how it should look when i finish, and another image with colors and fonts I should use).

Firstly, I added all initial elements to an html file, in which I will add further more nedded elements as I progress in making the landing page.

After I finished with adding elements to html, I procedeed with css. First, I finished navigation bar, then i finished Hero with text, button and placeholder. For this part I used flexbox to move objects as needed for finishing my assingment.
