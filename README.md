# Project-Landing-Page

My TOP project suggests making a landing page from scratch, with provided design ( consisted of a image how it should look when i finish, and another image with colors and fonts I should use).

Firstly, I added all initial elements to an html file, in which I will add further more nedded elements as I progress in making the landing page.

After I finished with adding elements to html, I procedeed with css. First, I finished navigation bar, then i finished Hero with text, button and placeholder. For this part I used flexbox to move objects as needed for finishing my assingment.

I proceeded by adding 4 photos with description to them, added blue borders as on recomended design. I did all that with flexbox, used space-evenly option to arange pictures as in design provided. Afther that, I did the same with the description.

Next thing, I did quote, with it's background and font size and design as provided. For now, I struggle with possitioning author of the quote to be in the place exactly like in the design. Will work on that in the end.

Next, I did "Call to action" with button, and proceeded with footer. 

I used flexbox for everything.
